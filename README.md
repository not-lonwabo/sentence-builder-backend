# Getting API Started

## Available Scrips

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies for you to be able to run the app.

### `node server`

This will run your API on http://localhost:5000 and then you should be able to make api request on your front-end.

This is all you'll need to do for the backend.
